# MAVS AVT-341 Example
MAVS package to interface with the AVT-341 autonomy algorithms for simulation.

## Requirements
Ubuntu 16.04 with [ROS-Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and a functioning [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) are required to build and run this code. It **may** work with more recent releases of Ubuntu but has not been tested.

## Installation
Clone the repo into your catkin_ws/src directory with the following command.
```bash
$git clone https://github.com/CGoodin/mavs_avt_example.git
```
From the top level catkin_ws directory, type
```bash
$catkin_make install
```
